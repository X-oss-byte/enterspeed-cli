### Added
- Added support for JavaScript schemas

### Fixed
- Made environment required for list-deployed command as it always has been, we just threw an internal exception before

### Breaking changes
- The JavaScript format is new the default format when creating schemas through the CLI
- To make it easier for you we have aligned naming convention so that commands are singular (`views` has been renamed to `view` to be consitent with the other commands)
- To make it easier for you we have aligned naming convention for all options to be kebab-case instead of a mix of camelCase and kebab-case
